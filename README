Unfortunately we did not finish the functionality of the game but did get the graphics mostly done. The idea was that each column button referring to a column on the board. You press one of the dice buttons then a column, a piece from that column would then move to the column that many away. We also planned on having the board animatedly spin when player turns changed.
